## Description
A patcher for Cry of Fear on Linux, addressing various bugs by replacing game build and engine DLL files with patched versions. The patcher automates the process, making it easier for users to apply the necessary modifications. Written in Crystal.

## Usage
To use the patcher follow these steps:
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/morphineaddicted/cof-linux-patcher`
- Navigate to the cloned repo: `cd cof-linux-patcher`
- Grant patcher executable permissions: `chmod +x patcher`
- Run the patcher: `./patcher` <br><br>

The whole process will look like this:
```
[kys fedora ~/Coding/Crystal/cof-patcher] $ ./patcher
[~] Enter your FULL path (should begin with /home/) to Cry of Fear installation:

<br>

**Patcher assumes that you have installed Cry of Fear along with the Proton 5.13-6.** <br> 
The patcher will prompt you to enter the **FULL** path to your Cry of Fear installation (should begin with `/home/`). After entering the path, it will check the directory's existence and proceed with the file replacements. <br>
> If you install Cry of Fear through Steam, typically the path is `/home/your_username/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Cry of Fear`.

## Optional Arguments
- `-h, --help`: Display the help message and exit.
- `-v, --version`: Display the version of the patcher build and exit.

## Patched files
The patcher replaces several files to improve the Cry of Fear experience on Linux. Here's a summary of the modifications:
1. `cof.exe` - Replaces the main game executable. [It is an official patch from Team Psyksckallar](https://www.moddb.com/games/cry-of-fear/downloads/cry-of-fear-crash-patch-for-64-bit-users). Uses x64 bit instead of x32, make the game generally much more stable.
2. `opengp32.dll` - Used for dynamic lighting. References to it are corrected in `/hw.dll` and `/cryoffear/cl_dlls/client.dll`. Wine may lack the `wglGetDefaultProcAddress` function. To address this, I've patched Cry of Fear's `opengl32.dll` by changing occurrences of `jne(75)` to `jmp(EB)` at the specific addresses:
```
Address     To    From
000066DB    EB    75
00006702    EB    75
00006728    EB    75
